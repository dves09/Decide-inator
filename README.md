# Decideinator
Decideinator is a simple program that I made to generate/pick a random option from objects that we can input themed upon a childhood memory. The way it works is simple, all we need to do is input however many strings we would like into the program! Once we are done we can type in the prompt which is 'Decide!'. This would then lead the program to the deciding prompt. It would then pick one of the options that we put in! It even has a feature to remove picked options so that it wont come up again!

# Vector Usage
In the decideinator, we will utilize the vector. This is because the vector can increase its size automatically. This way, we can store an indefinite amount of inputs in the vector!

**Input Data**

Here we are expected to put as many input as possible to be the choices of the decideinator. Once we are done we can simply type in the prompt 'Decide!'

**Activation**

Here we are asked if we want to generate the data or not.

**Data Generation**

Now, the decideinator will pick a random option from the inputs and then ask again if we want to generate another output or not.

**Delete Previous Output**

We also have the option to delete the previous outcome so that on the next decider, the items that are already picked wont be picked again. It is to be noted that if there are no choices left in the vector, the program will end.

**The End?**

If we decide not to generate a response (again or at all) then this prompt will appear and the program will end.
