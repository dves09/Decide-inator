# Decideinator
Decideinator is a simple program that I made to generate/pick a random option from objects that we can input. The way it works is simple, all we need to do is input however many strings we would like into the program! Once we are done we can type in the prompt which is 'Decide!'. This would then lead the program to the deciding prompt. It would then pick one of the options that we put in! It even has a feature to remove picked options so that it wont come up again!

# Vector Usage
In the decideinator, we will utilize the vector. This is because the vector can increase its size automatically. This way, we can store an indefinite amount of inputs in the vector!
